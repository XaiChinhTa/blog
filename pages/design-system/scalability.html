<h3>Vertical Scaling</h3>
<p class="space-40">
    Vertical Scaling is a concept of putting more computing power into the system such as adding more CPUs, more RAM, more Disk, ... to speed it up.
    <br>
    But as you know, at some time, you will exhaust your money or meet state of the art and you can not scale it in vertical anymore.
    <br>
    So vertical scaling is limited.
