<p><strong>Mother vertex</strong> is a node such that all other nodes can be reached by a path from that node.</p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p><strong>Disconnected Graph</strong> has no mother vertex.</p>
    <p>In <strong>Undirected Connected Graph</strong>, all nodes are the mother vertices.</p>
    <p>In <strong>Directed Connected Graph</strong>, we need to find the mother vertex.</p>
