    <p>The class responsibility depends on how the application changes.</p>
    <p>
        If <u>the application changes in ways that affect one of all the responsibilities</u>, then the design will smell of

        So we need to separate the class base on the responsibilities
    </p>
    <p>
        In the other hand, <u>the application changes in ways that not affect any responsibilities</u>, we don't need to separate the class. <br>
        Indeed, separating them would smell of

<div class="space-60">
    <div data-target='question-1'>
        <p><strong>Why does the class should have only one responsibility ?</strong></p>
        <div class="space-60">
            <p>When the requirements change, that change will be manifest through a change in responsibility amongst the classes</p>
            <p>If a class has more than one responsibility, change a class for a responsibility may effect another. That make the design broken in unexpected changes</p>
