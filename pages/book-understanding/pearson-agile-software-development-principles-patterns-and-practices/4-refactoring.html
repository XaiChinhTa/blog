<p>Every module or code block always has 3 functions. While one function of all function is broken, it needs to be refactored even though it works.</p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p><strong>The reason of the exist of the module of code block. What it performs while executing.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Afford to change</strong>: When a module or code block is not simple and possible to change or extend, it is broken.</p>
    <p><strong>Communicate with its readers</strong>. This function helps the developers who unfamiliar with the module should be able and easy to read and understand. When the module or code block is too hard to understand, it's broken.</p>
</div>

<p>In the factoring process, we might face to extracting a big function to some small functions.</p>
<p>In some cases, that functions is called only once time that affects the performance. We will use perfomance and pain test to consider we should extract function or not.</p>
