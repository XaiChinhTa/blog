    <p>Open-Closed Principle is a guildance that help we keep the designs stable in all versions of the software</p>

                This means that the behavior of module can be extended. As the requirements of the application change,
                we are able to extend the module with new behaviors that satisfy those changes. In other words, we are able
                to change what the module does.

        <p><strong>Closed for Modification</strong></p>
        <div class="space-60">
            <p>Extending the behavior of a module does not change the source code.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>When Open-Closed Principle is applied, <mark>the feature changes are archieved by adding new code, not by changing old code</mark> that already works.</p>
    <p>The normal way to extend the behavior of a module is to make changes to the source code of that module</p>
    <p><mark>How is it possible that the behaviors of a module can be modified without changing its source code ?</mark></p>
    <p><mark>How can we change what a module does, without changing the module ?</mark></p>

    <p>When we add new type of <code>Shape</code>, we need to search and modify all <code>if/else</code> or <code>switch</code> statements.</p>
