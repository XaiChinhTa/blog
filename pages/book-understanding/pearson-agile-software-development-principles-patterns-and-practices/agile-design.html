<p><strong>If agile is about building software in tiny increments, how can we see a big picture to design the software ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>In an agile team, the big picture evolves along with the software. With each iteration, the team improves the design of the system so that it is as good as it can be for the system</p>
    <p>Instead of trying to build the infrastructure to support the future requirements, we focus on the current structure of the system, making it as good as it can be.</p>

<p><strong>How to know a software design is poor ?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p><strong>Rigidity</strong> - The design is hard to change</p>
    <p><strong>Fragility</strong> - The design is easy to break</p>
    <p><strong>Immobility</strong> - The design is hard to reuse</p>
    <p><strong>Viscosity</strong> - It is hard to do the right thing</p>
    <p><strong>Needless Complexity</strong> - Overdesign</p>
    <p><strong>Needless Repetition</strong> - Mouse abuse</p>
    <p><strong>Opacity</strong> - Disorganized expression</p>

<p><strong>How to know and evaluate a design is hard to change ?</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>A design is hard to change if a single change causes a cascade of subsequent changes in dependent modules</p>
    <p>When take a change in a system, developers need to estimate for that change. But later, they work through the change, they realize they need to change hug portions of the codes, modify far modules than they had estimated.</p>

<p><strong>How to know and evaluate a design is easy to break ?</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>When a single change is made, the program is broken in many places.</p>
    <p>When the developers try to fix those problems, that leads to even more problems.</p>
    <p>When a change is made, that also makes unexpected problems.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>How to know and evaluate a design is hard to reuse ?</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>When the system contains parts that could be useful in other systems</p>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>How to know and evaluate a design is needless repedition ?</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>The design contains repeating structures that could be unified under a single abstraction.</p>
    <p>But the effort and risk involved with separating those parts from the original system are too high.</p>

<p><strong>How to know and evaluate a design is hard to do the right thing (Viscosity) ?</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>A viscous project is a project in which the design of the software is hard to preserve</p>
    <p>Viscosity has two forms:</p>
    <p>Viscosity of the software</p>
    <div class="space-60">
        <p>When faced with a change, the developers have many ways to make that change.</p>
        <p>Some ways keep the design and some way do not.</p>
        <p>If the ways which keep the design harder to do than rest. That is the viscosity of the software.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Viscosity of the environment</p>
    <div class="space-60">
        <p>Viscosity of environment comes about when the development environment is slow and inefficient</p>
    </div>

<p><strong>How to know and evaluate a design is overdesign ?</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>When it contains elements that <abbr title="How to evaluate a element is currently useful or not ?">arenâ€™t currently useful</abbr></p>
