<h3>Liskov Substituable Principle</h3>

    <p>
        Liskov Substituable Principle is one of the prime enablers of the

            Open-Closed Principle

    <p>Confirming <strong>LSP</strong> provides the substitutability of subtypes that allows a module, expressed in terms of a base type, to be extensible without modification</p>

<h3>Unsubstituable</h3>
<div class="space-60">
    <pre>
        class Shape() { 
            public get_shape() {
                // return shape
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <pre>
        class Circle extends Shape() {
            public draw() {
                // draw circle
            }
        }

        class Square extends Shape() {
            public draw() {
                // draw square
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <pre>
        drawShape(shape) {
            if (typeof shape == 'Square') {
                shape.cast_to(Square).draw();
            }
            else if (typeof shape == 'Circle') {
                shape.cast_to(Circle).draw();
            }
        }
    </pre>
    <br>
    <p>With above design, <code>Cirle</code> and <code>Square</code> didn't override <code>draw method</code> from <code>Shape</code>.</p>
    <p>Since <code>Cirle</code> and <code>Square</code> are not substitutable for <code>Shape</code>.</p>
    <p><code>drawShape</code> need to inspect its argument <code>shape</code> to detect the type. So this design violated <strong>LSP</strong>.</p>
    <p>
        This violation forced the violation of 
        <a href="#pages/book-understanding/pearson-agile-software-development-principles-patterns-and-practices/7-open-closed-principle.html"><strong>OCP</strong></a>.
        <mark>
            Thus, a violation of <strong>LSP</strong> is a latent violation of 
            <a href="#pages/book-understanding/pearson-agile-software-development-principles-patterns-and-practices/7-open-closed-principle.html"><strong>OCP</strong></a>.

<h3>Principle Meaning</h3>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>In example <mark>Square and Rectangle</mark> in page 113, we can see the substituable violation.</p>
    <p>A model, viewed in isolation, cannot be meaningfully validated. It's only validated by the client after they use.</p>
    <p>When considering whether a particular design is appropriate or not, <mark>we must view it in terms of the reasonable assumptions made by the users of that design</mark>. Often we will find that those reasonable assumptions are asserted in the unit tests written for the base class</p>
    <p>
        But what assumption is reasonable? Indeed, if we tried to anticipate them, the design has the smell of 
        <a href="#pages/book-understanding/pearson-agile-software-development-principles-patterns-and-practices/5-what-is-agile-design.html">
            <strong>Needless Complexity</strong>
        </a>
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, it is often best to defer all but the most obvious LSP violations until the related Fragility has been smelled.</p>
