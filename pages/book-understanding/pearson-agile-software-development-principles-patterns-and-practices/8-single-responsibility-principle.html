                  title="Why does the class should have only one responsibility ?">

        .
    </p>
    <p>The class responsibility depends on how the application changes.</p>
    <p>
        If <u>the application changes in ways that affect one of all the responsibilities</u>, then the design will smell of

            <strong>Rigidity</strong>
        </a>. <br>
        So we need to separate the class base on the responsibilities
    </p>
    <p>
        In the other hand, <u>the application changes in ways that not affect any responsibilities</u>, we don't need to separate the class. <br>
        Indeed, separating them would smell of

<h4>Mistake</h4>
<div class="space-60">
    <p><strong>Code duplication</strong></p>
    <p>
        Sometime, we see the logic code is duplicated at many where and we decide to group it into a function or module to reuse it. <br>
        Normally, we didnt care much about which factor can make the code change. <br>
        After long time, we have to change that function or module to adapt one or more factor, we usually miss some another factor. <br>
        So the factor who need the change will work well but another is not.
    </p>
    <p><strong>In this case, we should have a design to group that code into a function or module and easy to extend for only change factor if it need.</strong></p>

<h3>Questions</h3>
<div class="space-60">
    <div data-target='question-1'>
        <p><strong>Why does the class should have only one responsibility ?</strong></p>
        <div class="space-60">
            <p>When the requirements change, that change will be manifest through a change in responsibility amongst the classes</p>
            <p>If a class has more than one responsibility, change a class for a responsibility may effect another. That make the design broken in unexpected changes</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div data-target="question-2">
        <p><strong>What is responsibility ?</strong></p>
        <div class="space-60">
            <p>
                In the context of the Single Responsibility Principle, the <strong>responsibility is a reason to change</strong>. <br>
                The reason is the customer's requirements. So we can understand that <strong>A module should be responsible to one, and only one, user or stakeholder.</strong> <br>
