<p><strong>What is a software design ?</strong></p>
<div class="space-60">
    <p>The UML diagrams may represent parts of design, but it is not the design</p>
    <p>The design of a software project is an abstract concept</p>
    <p>The design can be represented by many different media, but its final embodiment is source code (the detailed shape and structure of each module, class, and method)</p>
