<div class="space-60">
    <p>If the <a href="#pages/book-understanding/pearson-agile-software-development-principles-patterns-and-practices/11-dependency-inversion-principle.html">Dependency Inversion Principle</a> guides us that all objects should depend on the abstraction.</p>
    <p>So the <strong>Interface Segregation Principle</strong> help us to organize and design that abstraction.</p>
    <p>The principle makes 6 points:</p>
    <div class="space-60">
        <p><strong>1.</strong> Each client has each own interface.</p>
        <div class="space-60">
            <p><strong>-</strong> The client is something uses that interface. It can be an another class, program, ...</p>
            <p><strong>-</strong> Because the interface is owned by the client. So clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.</p>
            <p><strong>-</strong> When the client is seperated. The interface should be seperated too. Because clients exert forces on the interfaces they use</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>2.</strong> When the interface changes, it effects on its clients. And the client can make its interface change.</p>
        <p><strong>3.</strong> The ways to seperate the interface.</p>
        <div class="space-60">
            <p><strong>-</strong> Separation through Delegation</p>
            <p><strong>-</strong> Separation through Multiple Inheritance (Prefer to use)</p>
        </div>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> Polyadic form is refer than Monadic form</p>
        <p><strong>5.</strong> Sometimes, the methods invoked by different clients or group of clients will overlap. If the overlap is small, then the interfaces for that groups or clients should remain seperate.</p>
        <p><strong>6.</strong> When we maintains a app and we need to change the interfaces. If that change have a huge impact, the impact should be migrated by adding new interfaces to existing objects, rather than changing the existing interfaces.</p>
